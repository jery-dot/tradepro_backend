                our "Minimum Age."

              <p>
                "Minimum Age" means 16 years old. However, if law requires that
                you must be older in order for TradePro to lawfully provide the
                Services to you without parental consent (including using of
                your personal data) then the Minimum Age is such older age.

                Members who were below this new Minimum Age when they started

                to use them, as they have already reached the new Minimum Age
                since then or will reach it in the near future.

A worldwide, transferable and sublicensable right to use, copy, modify, distribute, publish and process, information and content that you provide through our Services and the services of others, without any further consent, notice and/or compensation to you or others.
